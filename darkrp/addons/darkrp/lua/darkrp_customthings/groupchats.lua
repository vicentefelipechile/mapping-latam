Team chat for when you have a certain job.

talk to one another through /g or team chat.

HOW TO MAKE A GROUP CHAT:
Simple method:
GAMEMODE:AddGroupChat(List of team variables separated by comma)

Advanced method:
GAMEMODE:AddGroupChat(a function with ply as argument that returns whether a random player is in one chat group)
This is for people who know how to script Lua.
